oldschool 2d maze crawler in WPF

With this project I tried to teach my 9 year old son the basics of programming. That's why most of the code is in dutch. It was a mixed success. It appeared that he is a very enthousiastic beta-tester, but I ended up writing the game myself. I enjoyed it so much (and still do), that I will not abandon the project anytime soon, but keep on inventing cool stuff !

Have fun experimenting with the code and playing the game !
